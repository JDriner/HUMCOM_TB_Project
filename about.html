                <p>Balbalan is rugged tableland on the Cordillera Central Range that sprawls in a descending eastward direction, in massive mountain alluvial fashion. It has a total land area of 51,900 hectares and is approximately 70 kilometers away from
                    the capital town of Tabuk. It has six prominent mountain peaks with altitudes ranging from 2,000 meters to 2,300 meters above sea level. It has two rivers, Saltan and Mabaca, with headwaters from the Cordilleras and tributaries drain
                    cascading eastward to join the Chico River then the Cagayan River. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Conner, on the south by the municipality of Pasil, on the east by the municipality of Pinukpuk and the west by the
                    province of Abra.</p>

                <p>In the olden Kalinga days when headhunting was a way of life and tribal wars were common, the people of northern Kalinga were prone to carrying out their headhunting trade in southern Kalinga. In this trade, headhunters in northern Kalinga
                    had to cross a saddle like portion of a mountain where a creek of ice water constantly flowed.</p>
                <p>During these headhunting forays, a densely forested area was designated as the converging area for these warriors who came from different places. It was here where they decided how to attack a village. This same area was used as rendezvous
                    after an attack since retreat was undertaken in all directions to mislead the enemy. While resting and waiting for their companions, these warriors would wash or in Kalinga “balbal” their weapons and themselves from the blood stains.
                    Eventually, the creek including its vicinity came to be called “Balbalan”.</p>
                <p>During the American occupation, Kalinga was divided into townships (municipal district) and one of these was Balbalan. Through the years, changes in the composition of the districts were initiated so that the site was transferred to the
                    present site at Salegseg. The name Balbalan was named Balbalan Proper.</p>

                <h4>Farming</h4>
                <p>Farming is the primary livelihood that the People in Kalinga is relying to. Rice cultivation is an industry common in most Filipino communities but rice paddies carved along steep mountain slopes are one of the features unique in Cordillera
                    provinces. The Cordillera's rice terraces are found in Ifugao, Mountain Province, Benguet, Kalinga, some parts of Abra, and Apayao.

                    Over the years, the different provinces have come up with their own systems of preserving and managing the rice terraces as livelihood and food source.These systems, utilizing local knowledge on biodiversity, agro-ecosystems, and agriculture are entwined
                    with the ways of life of the Cordillera people.</p>

                    records indicate the presence of 1.96 million metric tons of gold, 960.6 million metric tons of copper, and 3000 metric tons of manganese.</p>

                <p>Among the six major mountain peoples of Northern Luzon, only two, the Kalinga and the Apayao, maintain hunting and fishing as an appreciable supplement to their regular food gathering and growing activities. But although the Kalinga are
                    probably. the third most thoroughly studied group, after the Bontoc and Ifugao, there is little in the literature on their hunting and fishing techniques, terms, cere· monies, omens, seasons. </p>

                <p>Kabuniyan is the Supreme Being. Their deity beliefs are typed into three: nature spirits (pinaing and aran), dead ancestors and relatives (kakarading and anam), and mythological heroes. Illness and death are attributed to malevolent anitos
                    and vengeful spirits. For a prolonged illness, a medium is called to assess the liver of the sacrificial animal. The preceding night, for appeasement of the spirits, the men gather in merrymaking, dancing the salisid and playing the
                    tungatong. Before the healing rite (dawak) is performed by the medium, the house is decorated with ferns in its four corners. Animals are butchered for sacrifice. If the healing is not successful, a herbalist , nabdadagop, is called
                    with his preparation of plants (balat) that is administered to the patient. If death is imminent, the ritual of songnga is performed, a death ceremony, without the accompaniment of merrymaking, the medium pouring the blood of the sacrificial
                    animal on the dying patient.</p>
