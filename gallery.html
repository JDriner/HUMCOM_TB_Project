            <p>Pottery is a traditional craft of the local tribes in Kalinga. Clay is the most important and earth’s most abundant raw materials <a href="http://www.garph.co.uk/IJARMSS/June2016/51.pdf">(Kalinga State University, 2016).</a></p>
            <p>Pottery is a timeless occupation and the best pots through the ages have an equality of timelessness about then that transcends chronological and cultural boundaries. The essence of design and form, the quality of surface, the hidden meanings
                and the integration with mankind’s’ daily existence over several thousand years, all add to the significance of the art.</p>
            <p>In the contemporary art arena, pottery has been looked at as the poor cousin to paintingand sculpture in much the same way that the graphical arts were viewed. Pottery neitherpainting nor sculpture although has elements of both. Pottery has
                concerns that are quitedifferent from most other media of expression.</p>

            <p>The Kalinga tribe is recognized as the most feared and most prolific of all Filipino Head Hunters, on Luzon Island, in the Philippines. Their strong sense of tribal membership and loyalty results in frequent tribal unrest and occasional outright
                war. Due to the mountainous terrain and warrior culture, the Kalinga were able to preserve their culture despite centuries of occupation in the lowlands by the Spaniards, Americans, and the Japanese.</p>
