                <p>The Balbalasang-Balbalan National Park and Banao watershed area in the Northern Cordillera is proof of the inherent capacity of indigenous communities in natural resource protection and management. Through the Banao tribe’s <a href="https://newcapp.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/lapat-system-bodong-banao-balatoc-kalinga/">“lapat”</a> tradition, the area continues to maintain one of the most extensive tracts of old growth forest in the country.</p>
                <p>The Balbalasang-Balbalan National Park is located in the town of Balbalan in Kalinga, which is near the border that the province shares with Abra. It centers around Mount Balbalasang, which is why the park is also called Mount Balbalasang National Park.</p>

                <p>In the olden Kalinga days when headhunting was a way of life and tribal wars were common, the people of northern Kalinga were prone to carrying out their headhunting trade in southern Kalinga. In this trade, headhunters in northern Kalinga had to cross a saddle like portion of a mountain where a creek of ice water constantly flowed.</p>

                <p>Buaya caves feature various stalactite and stalagmite rock formations. There are beautiful chambers inside, reminiscent of a cathedral’s domes and spires.</p>
                <p>To get deeper inside the cave, expect to rappel, climb on rocks, and wade across pools. Yes, there’s a small brook inside. There are also waterfalls.</p>
                <p>On some parts of the cave, you would feel like you are in the golden chamber. The caves are interconnected from each other and form a chain covering the whole mountain slope.</p>

                <p>Maanus Cave is situated just a kilometer away from the center of barangay Tawang. It is indeed, a cave so big and wide in ground similar to a bus terminal ground. Many would think that it may not appear that tall and wide because the entrance hole of it has only a meter-wide dimension.</p>

                <p>After crawling a meter away from the entrance hole, one will be surprised how wide and tall those walls inside which are being decorated by centuries-old stalagmites and/or stalactites. Maanus Cave is also being compartmentalized by nature into many subways inside that may go on for a kilometer in length but tall and wide enough to pass through. It may need some signage to be posted in each subway for convenience in knowing the direction of its entrance and exit.</p>

                <p>This waterfall, where one of its pools is locally known as “BATTONG ALAN,” is situated at the remote village of Ligayan, barangay Balantoy. It can be reached by walk of less than an hour from the end of the ongoing construction of the municipal road of Balantoy. This municipal road is connected to the Kalinga-Abra National Road where it winds through the village of Bolo of said barangay.</p>
                <p>The headwater of this fall comes from a forested mountain, the Lulutuan mountain range, which served as the tri- ancestral domain boundary landmark of the tribes of Salegseg, Poswoy, and Buaya tribe. It is vegetated by narra trees, red and white laoan, among other forest hardwood of Balbalan forests. The mountain inhabits various wild animals like wild boars, deer, weasel, red ring-necked wild doves (or “balog”), wild chickens, among others. This waterfall drains its waters down to the Saltan River of the tribe of Dao-angan.</p>
